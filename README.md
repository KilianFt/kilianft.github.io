I am interest in exploring the intersection of human and machines in various way, mainly from a learning-based perspective. Currently that includes
- robotics
- interactive learning
- human-machine interfaces
- agentic systems

In this realm I am pursuing a PhD at Chalmers. Please reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss ideas.

## Current Research
### Collaborative robot learning in manipulation
In several industrial settings robots and humans have to work in the same space. While the mobile-robot perspective cannot be disregarded, here we mainly consider manipulation. Specifically, we want to build manipulators that can collaboratively sort items or route cables.

### Interactive training of human-computer interfaces
Human-computer interfaces are traditionally trained by collecting supervised data. We believe that further online learning in interactive settings enhances performance and can help mitigate distributional shift. Thus we proposed learning such interfaces in a game setting with iterative RL in [this work](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pJv1QJBhiN#all).
Current work involves making the proposed method more flexible to different users and to enable continuous control.

### Web-Agents
We are a group of people interested in web agents, specifically in how a hierarchy of models can enhance execution time and performance.
